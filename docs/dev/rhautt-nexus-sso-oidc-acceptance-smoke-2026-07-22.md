# Rhautt Nexus SSO OIDC Acceptance Smoke - 2026-07-22

## Scope

Issue: `docs/dev/rhautt-nexus-sso-oidc-issues/08-local-production-sso-acceptance-smoke.md`

This smoke checked the real IdP discovery document, local SSO route behavior, safe redirect negatives, production first-hop availability, and the final guard/test commands. It does not record or expose any `client_secret`, authorization code, raw access token, raw ID token, state value, or cookie value.

## Configuration Under Test

IdP issuer: `https://ai.rhautt.com`

Discovery: `https://ai.rhautt.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`

Local client:

- app URL: `http://localhost:4000`
- client_id: `cli_mrvdz1yr8jfzrb8u`
- callback: `http://localhost:4000/api/v2/auth/sso/callback`
- SSO entry: `http://localhost:4000/api/v2/auth/sso/login?redirect=/hub`
- post-login landing: `http://localhost:4000/hub`

Production client:

- app URL: `https://nexus.rhautt.com`
- client_id: `cli_mrve0bgvgnl2gkjg`
- callback: `https://nexus.rhautt.com/api/v2/auth/sso/callback`
- SSO entry: `https://nexus.rhautt.com/api/v2/auth/sso/login?redirect=/hub`
- post-login landing: `https://nexus.rhautt.com/hub`

## Results

| Check                                      | Result                         | Evidence                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Issuer was `https://ai.rhautt.com`; authorization endpoint, token endpoint, and JWKS URI were present.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Real local callback/token exchange cannot be completed without server-side secret injection.                                                                                                                |

Escalated service start created a Node process, but direct HTTP calls returned HTTP 500 for `/api/v2/health` and `/api/v2/auth/sso/login?redirect=/hub`.

## Commands Run

- `node -e "<discovery and production first-hop fetch>"`
- `node -e "<sanitized OIDC env-key presence check>"`
- `node scripts/start-api.js` with local SSO non-secret env values and `PORT/API_PORT=4000`
- `node -r ts-node/register/transpile-only -e "<Fastify inject local SSO smoke>"`
- `npm.cmd run guard:routes`
- `npm.cmd run test:api-units`
- PowerShell equivalent: `node -r ts-node/register/transpile-only --test <services/api/src/**/*.nodetest.ts>`
- `npm.cmd run test:production-readiness`
- `node node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js test/production-readiness --runInBand --silent --json --outputFile <scratch file>`
- `npm.cmd run harness:arch`

## Blockers

1. Local real E2E smoke is blocked until OIDC runtime env is injected outside the repository, especially `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`, and the local bound service is healthy on `http://localhost:4000`.
2. Production real E2E smoke is blocked because `https://nexus.rhautt.com/api/v2/auth/sso/login?redirect=/hub` returns HTTP 404 and does not redirect to `https://ai.rhautt.com`.
3. Final production readiness gates are still red because required audit harness files and several existing readiness evidence/contracts are missing or failing.
4. Real IdP user/account behavior, claim mapping, local user binding, `/hub` landing, and post-login `GET /api/v2/auth/me` remain unverified in live local and production flows.

## Launch Readiness Assessment

Rhautt Nexus SSO OIDC is not yet ready to declare production launch-ready. The code-level SSO unit coverage and in-process first-hop/negative smoke are strong, and IdP discovery is reachable, but the required real local and production acceptance flows did not complete. Production currently fails at the SSO entry URL with HTTP 404, and the final route/architecture/production-readiness gates are not green.
