# 5000 Dealer Workbench existing feature retention checklist

Source issue: `docs/dev/dealer-workbench-hermes-style-ui-redesign-issues/00-existing-feature-inventory.md`

This is a pre-redesign inventory for `apps/dealer-workbench`. The Hermes-style UI redesign cannot be accepted if any listed route, entry point, control, form, upload/import/export action, pagination control, publish/shelf action, permission state, loading state, empty state, or error state disappears unless a follow-up issue explicitly removes it.

This inventory is documentation-only. It does not redesign UI, change CSS, alter APIs, or change business behavior.

## Verification snapshot

Inventory date: 2026-07-24

Route source checked:

- `apps/dealer-workbench/src/app`
- `apps/dealer-workbench/src/components`
- `apps/dealer-workbench/src/lib/workbench-navigation.ts`
- `apps/dealer-workbench/package.json`
- `apps/dealer-workbench/scripts`

Route list was verified by enumerating every `page.tsx` under `apps/dealer-workbench/src/app`. API route files under `src/app/api` are excluded from UI scope.

## Global shell and navigation

Files:

- `apps/dealer-workbench/src/app/layout.tsx`
- `apps/dealer-workbench/src/components/DealerNav.tsx`
- `apps/dealer-workbench/src/lib/workbench-navigation.ts`

Retention checklist:

- [ ] Keep `DealerNav` plus `TopBar` shell on authenticated workbench pages.
- [ ] Keep `DealerNav` hidden on `/`, `/mobile`, and `/hub`.
- [ ] Keep left primary navigation entries from `WORKBENCH_NAV`: brand sites, growth, products, accounts.
- [ ] Keep subnavigation collapse/expand with persisted `localStorage` key `rhautt-subnav-collapsed`.
- [ ] Keep active state for product query modules: `/products?module=catalog`, `/products?module=materials`, `/products?module=base`.
- [ ] Keep dynamic brand-site subnav entries loaded from active, non-deleted brand sites.
- [ ] Keep account trigger, profile display, role label, logout menu, and logout behavior.
- [ ] Keep mobile bottom nav entries for products, brand, and accounts.
- [ ] Keep auth profile cache read/write through `localStorage.user`.

## Redesign acceptance rule

For every redesigned page:

1. Check this document before editing UI.
2. Copy that page's checklist into the implementation issue or PR notes.
3. Verify each retained item manually or by smoke/build automation.
4. Reject the redesign if a listed function is missing, hidden, blocked, or semantically changed without a separate approved issue.
