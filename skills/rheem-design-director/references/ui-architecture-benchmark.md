## Required UI Architecture Capabilities

### 1. Multi-Concept Exploration

For important screens, create at least two viable UI directions:

- Engineering Console: dense, operational, table/diagram heavy.
- Commercial Solution: role-based, support/logistics heavy.
- Customer Presentation: visual, simplified, benefit-led.

Compare them by audience, workflow fit, Rheem brand fit, implementation effort, and responsive risk.

### 2. Information Density Rules

Rheem professional tools should be dense but orderly:

- Keep core metrics, status, and next action visible above the fold.
- Prefer tables and comparison matrices for specs.
- Use cards only for repeated items, grouped metrics, product entries, or actions.
- Avoid card stacks that do not support decisions.
- Use dashboard surfaces for current project state, equipment selection, load/pipe calculations, quotation, documentation, and support.

### 3. State Architecture

Every interactive surface needs states:

- Default
- Hover
- Focus
- Active/selected
- Disabled
- Loading
- Empty
- Error
- Warning
- Success

States must be visually distinct without relying only on color.

### 4. Handoff Rules

Design handoff should specify:

- Screen purpose and user role.
- Component inventory.
- Responsive behavior.
- Token names.
- Data requirements.
- Empty/error/loading behavior.
- Accessibility notes.
- Visual QA checklist.

### 5. Anti-Generic Rules

Reject designs that:

- Look like unbranded v0/shadcn defaults.
- Use gradients or glass panels as the main visual idea.
- Overuse oversized cards and hero copy.
- Hide actual product/system details.
- Lack real workflow states.
- Cannot explain why each module exists.
